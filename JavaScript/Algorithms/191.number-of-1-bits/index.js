/**
 * n & (n - 1) drops the lowest set bit. It's a neat little bit trick.
 *
 * Let's use n = 00101100 as an example. This binary representation has three 1s.
 *
 * If n = 00101100, then n - 1 = 00101011, so n & (n - 1) = 00101100 & 00101011 = 00101000. Count = 1.
 *
 * If n = 00101000, then n - 1 = 00100111, so n & (n - 1) = 00101000 & 00100111 = 00100000. Count = 2.
 *
 * If n = 00100000, then n - 1 = 00011111, so n & (n - 1) = 00100000 & 00011111 = 00000000. Count = 3.
 *
 * n is now zero, so the while loop ends, and the final count (the numbers of set bits) is returned.
 *
 * @param {Number} n
 * @returns {Number}
